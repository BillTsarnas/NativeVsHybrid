# nativeVshybrid

This project aims to compare the performance of a Native Android application with its equivalent (in terms of functionality) Hybrid (Apache Cordova) application.

The project has three parts:
 - An Android Native application, developed using Andrroid SDK with Android Studio.
 - A Hybrid mobile application, developed using the Ionic framework. It has almost the same interface and the same functionality with the native application.
 - A web server that collects live execution data from the two applications and registers them in a database. All the benchmarks are visualized in tables.
